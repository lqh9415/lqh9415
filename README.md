- 👋 Hi, I’m @lqh9415
- 👀 I am  a doctoral graduate from the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy. Her academic training is in public policy and methodologies and most of her research focuses on the nexus of institutions and environmental governance. Specifically, she is interested in investigating whether and how non-regulatory governance approaches can encourage organizations and individuals to be more environmentally sustainable, and how actors such as government, NGOs, private industries, and individuals create institutional arrangements to govern and protect natural resources. For her dissertation, she is studying the institutional design of multiple types of voluntary environmental programs implemented across the world, with particular concern for the green building certification, LEED.
